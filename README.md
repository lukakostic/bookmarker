Add all tabs in current window as bookmarks with 1 click  
In a new subdirectory (with custom title or current date-time as name)  
optionally close them all too after adding.  

For those who have many interests/projects and open many tabs and want to group save them all to certain interest related bookmark folder, for later reference.

Ability to add folder descriptions and tags comming soon.
